# Instructions for Pushing Changes to the Experiments Branch

## What's Ready to Push

The React modernization of the OpExec Group website is ready to be committed to the experiments branch. The following components have been completed:

1. ✅ Project setup (Vite, React, Tailwind CSS)
2. ✅ React component architecture
3. ✅ Component-based page structure
4. ✅ Responsive navigation
5. ✅ Static assets organization

## Push Instructions

Follow these steps to push the changes to the experiments branch:

### 1. Before Pushing

Make sure you have restarted your terminal or VS Code to pick up the newly added Node.js PATH.

### 2. Commit Changes

```powershell
# Add all the files to git
git add .

# Commit the changes with a descriptive message
git commit -m "React modernization: Initial implementation with component structure and Vite setup"
```

### 3. Push to Remote

```powershell
# Push the commits to the experiments branch
git push origin experiments
```

### 4. After Pushing

To test the React implementation:

1. Open a new terminal (to ensure Node.js is in the PATH)
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
4. Open the URL provided in the terminal (usually http://localhost:3000)

## Known Limitations

1. The contact form is still using the Google Forms embed. The custom form implementation will be added in Phase 4.
2. Images need to be optimized for better performance (Phase 3).
3. Code splitting and lazy loading need to be implemented (Phase 3).

## Future Work

Refer to the modernization-plan.md for details on upcoming phases:
- Phase 3: Performance optimization
- Phase 4: Backend integration
- Phase 5: Enhanced visual features
- Phase 6: Analytics and SEO optimization
- Phase 7: Testing and deployment
